## Overview

This repo contains:
- A **command reference file** used during the installation steps  
- A **notebook** for testing GPU utilization in TensorFlow and PyTorch  
- A short description and the video tutorial link (added in the repository details)

The workflow covers installation and validation of:  
- NVIDIA GPU drivers  
- CUDA Toolkit  
- cuDNN  
- TensorRT  
- TensorFlow (GPU-enabled)  
- PyTorch with CUDA support
